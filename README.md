# -Codsoft_task-3
I'm thrilled to share my #CODSOFT _TASK-3 from my AI internship with CodSoft ! ðŸŽ¬âœ¨

I've created a video tutorial on building a book recommendation system using Python. This project was part of my internship tasks, and it provided a deep dive into recommendation algorithms and their practical applications in eCommerce.

 I cover the entire process, from data preprocessing to implementing and evaluating the recommendation system. It was an incredible learning experience, and I hope it will be useful for anyone interested in AI, Python, and recommendation systems.
